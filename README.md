# Deep Reinforcement Learning for Production Scheduling

This repository presents a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework for optimizing production scheduling in real-world industrial settings. The project explores the use of Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithms to automate complex scheduling decisions under operational constraints, including product switching costs, limited capacity, and dynamic customer demand.

## Features

- DRL-based scheduling using DQN and A3C algorithms
- Custom Gym-compatible simulation environment
- Integration of real, anonymized industrial datasets
- Modular and extensible codebase for experimentation
- Gantt-style visualizations for generated schedules
